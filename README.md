## PAIRS GAME

This program is a game of pairs where the players turn cards and try to find corresponding cards. If the player guesses the cards right, they can continue their turn. Eventually when all the cards are turned correctly, the program will tell the winner or if there was a tie.

*A simple example of a won game*. 

This was done using remote desktop Linux which was provided from my university. This was also my first C++ project during my first year of studying Information Technology. This scored a 42/50 during grading, there was some schematic issues which took some points. This was also coded and run on QT Creator, which means that it might not run as smoothly on other IDEs.
